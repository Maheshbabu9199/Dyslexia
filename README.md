# About this Project

I'm excited to announce the launch of my new web application that utilizes machine learning to assist in dyslexia identification. This application aims to empower individuals by offering a **preliminary screening tool**.

Dyslexia is a learning disorder that affects reading fluency and comprehension. Early detection is crucial for ensuring proper intervention and support. My application leverages the power of machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forests, to analyze data points like reading performance, eye-tracking during reading, and responses to questionnaires. 

Here's how it works:

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Flask, a lightweight web framework, the application offers a simple and intuitive interface.
2. **Data Collection:** You'll be guided through a series of steps to provide relevant data points. 
3. **Machine Learning Analysis:** The  model analyzes your data and generates a prediction on the likelihood of dyslexia.



* This application is a **screening tool**, not a definitive diagnosis. 
* It aims to **flag potential dyslexia** and encourage users to seek professional evaluation.
* Early intervention through proper diagnosis can significantly improve learning outcomes for individuals with dyslexia.

This application represents a step forward in making dyslexia identification more accessible.  

**Stay tuned for further updates!**  In the future, I plan to incorporate additional features and explore the potential of other machine learning models for even greater accuracy.

**Let me know what you think!**  I welcome feedback and suggestions as I continue to develop this application.
